The Destiny of Species
======================

The year is 1835.  Charles Darwin has just reached the Galapagos, only to find
that the island hides a terrifying secret...

Tasks
-----
* Load a level and construct a scene
* Actor class for monsters, player
* Player controls
* Physics

Ideas (spoilers!)
-----------------
* Powerup by losing a life
  This will make the mechanic mostly around trying to get 1ups
  Start with none, so the player won't be so powerful
  On your 10th life or so you should be pretty awesome
* Obviously monsters need to spawn a lot of small monsters
* Fight through increasingly complex monsters
* Giant boss monster, spawns tons of small monsters
