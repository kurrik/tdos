Ideas (spoilers!)
-----------------
* Powerup by losing a life
  * This will make the mechanic mostly around trying to get 1ups
  * Start with none, so the player won't be so powerful
  * On your 10th life or so you should be pretty awesome
* Obviously monsters need to spawn a lot of small monsters
* Fight through increasingly complex monsters
* Giant boss monster, spawns tons of small monsters
